HW07 -- Xiang's Problem
2017-02-15

State space search:
1. Look through all possible states starting from an empty space (all possible positions to add a piece)
2. Look through each possible state from each new state
3. When you find a solution, add it to the list of possible solutions

Queen on chess board:
Put a queen on any possible position and recursively go through each possible successive position, skipping states in which a queen attacks another queen.
If no states are found that match the desired properties, then there are no solutions.

a) 2x2 - Putting a queen in any space immediately disqualifies any other spaces, so only one queen can be placed.
b) 3x3 - There are 3 possible starting positions without duplicates; none lead to having 3 queens on the board
c) 4x4 - There are 2 solutions (with reflections) found through trial and positioning new queens at a knight's move away

    ...Q  and  Q...

d) 5x5 - There are 2 distinct solutions (without reflections) found through trial and positioning new queens at a knight's move away
