State space search:
1. Look through all possible states starting from an empty space (all possible positions to add a piece)
2. Look through each possible state from each new state
3. When you find a solution, add it to the list of possible solutions

Queen on chess board:
Put a queen on any possible position and recursively go through each possible successive position, skipping states in which a queen attacks another queen.
If no states are found that match the desired properties, then there are no solutions.
